# FCast Slint UI — Phase Files

Each file in this directory tracks one phase of the Slint UI evolution plan.
Start with `PHASE-0` and work forward. See `../TODO.md` for the original
high-level overview, and `../futures/NOT-APPLICABLE.md` for per-Moblin-file
applicability triage.

> **Current implementation status — see [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md).**
> That file is the canonical, evidence-grounded snapshot of what is actually
> shipped in `senders/android/ui/` vs. what is still on paper. The
> per-phase `**Status:**` lines below are the source of truth for each
> individual phase, but `STATUS.md` consolidates them in one table with
> file-path evidence and flags any drift between the declared status and
> the live tree. Update it whenever a phase ships or its status changes.

## Roadmap shape

The roadmap is split into three bands:

- **Phases 0–11 (foundation):** audit, module split, theme, reusable
  components, control bar, status overlay, receiver list, settings root,
  Rust bridge gate, localization, validation, source tracking. Phases 5–7
  and 9–11 are **UI-only** placeholder specs (no Rust wiring); Phase 8
  is explicitly **deferred** until the UI is sealed.
- **Phases 12–27 (applicable-future / deferred placeholders):** one phase
  per cluster of `applicable-future` / `deferred` features from
  `../futures/NOT-APPLICABLE.md`. Every phase ships **UI without
  functionality** — controls flip inline `in-out` properties, no Bridge
  setters, no Rust callbacks. Phases 12–27 each include a Moblin SwiftUI
  source excerpt + Slint primitive mapping section.
- **Phases 28–48 (previously-excluded categories):** UI-only placeholders
  for every Moblin category originally tagged not-applicable (chat,
  navigation, replay, right-side overlays, streaming-platform,
  scene-widget, peripheral-hardware, ios-target, iap, moblin-internal,
  mediaplayer, broadcast deferrals). These render for visual
  completeness; Apple-target / IAP / Moblink / OpenAI surfaces live
  under `senders/android/ui/pages/_apple/` and are **never imported by
  `main.slint`** so they stay reference-only on Android.

## Quick-start order

```
Phase 0  →  Phase 1  →  Phase 2  →  Phase 3
                                         ├──→  Phase 4  →  Phase 5  →  Phases 12, 13, 39, 41
                                         ├──→  Phase 6  →  Phases 24
                                         └──→  Phase 7  →  Phases 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
                                                          19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26,

Reference-only phases (44, 45, 46) live under pages/_apple/ and are
not imported from main.slint.

Phase 27 is on-demand: pull when a downstream phase needs a util.
Phase 8 stays deferred until UI sign-off.
Phase 9 sweeps any UI phase's strings into @tr() after merge.
Phase 10 runs alongside every UI phase.
Phase 11 is a living reference, updated as phases complete.
```

## UI-only discipline

Phases 5–7 and 12–48 are **UI without functionality**:

- All stub data lives as inline `in-out property <[T]> mock-...` on the
  page component.
- Controls read/write the stub properties — no Rust callbacks, no Bridge
  setters.
- Audit greps in Phase 8 catch regressions
  (`Bridge.(status-items|quick-actions|app-version)` must not appear in UI
  files until that phase is reactivated).

This lets the UI evolve independently of Rust, ship as a previewable APK,
and absorb design feedback before any wiring work begins.

## Status key

Each phase file has a `**Status:**` line at the top:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[ ] Not started` | No work begun |
| `[ ] In progress` | Some tasks checked off |
| `[x] Complete` | All exit criteria met |
| `[ ] Blocked` | Waiting on a dependency (codec or decision) |
| `[ ] Deferred` | Intentionally parked (Phase 8 — Rust wiring; promoted later) |
| `Defer` | Intentionally excluded from current scope |

## What changed vs. the original `TODO.md`

The original `draft/slint-ui/TODO.md` (Phases 0–9) was speculative and
did not reference actual codebase paths. These phase files are grounded in
the real project:

- Phase 0 contains the actual `Bridge` contract table extracted from `main.slint`.
- Phases 1–3 include exact file paths and build-check steps.
- Phases 4–7 include concrete Slint code snippets.
- Phases 12–48 ship **UI without functionality**, each tied to a specific
  Moblin source group from `../futures/NOT-APPLICABLE.md`.
- Every phase doc (12–48) includes a Moblin SwiftUI source excerpt + a
  Slint primitive mapping section linking to upstream Slint docs.
- Phase 8 is reframed as a deferred Rust-wiring placeholder.
- The Appendix captures the dependency graph and codec blockers from `TODO.codecs.md`.
